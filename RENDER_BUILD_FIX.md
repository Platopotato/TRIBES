# Render Build Fix

This file exists to force a new commit and ensure Render deploys the latest code.

## TypeScript Error Fix Status

- ✅ DatabaseService line 224 has the fix: `(user: any)`
- ✅ Local build works perfectly
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

## Issue

Render keeps showing the same TypeScript error even though the fix is in place:
```
src/services/DatabaseService.ts(187,24): error TS7006: Parameter 'user' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

## Solution

This file forces a new commit to ensure Render uses the latest code with the TypeScript fix.

**Deploy this commit to resolve the persistent build error!**
