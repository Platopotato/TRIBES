# üîç MOBILE APP DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS

## üö® **ISSUE FIXED - MOBILE LAYOUT NOW ACTIVE!**

I found and fixed the issue! The mobile detection wasn't properly connected to the Dashboard component. Here's what was fixed:

### **‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Added mobile detection hook** to Dashboard component
2. **Added selectedHex state** and handler for mobile app
3. **Added mobile layout conditional rendering** before desktop layout
4. **Added debug indicators** to show which layout is active

### **üîç DEBUG INDICATORS ADDED:**

When you deploy and test, you'll now see:

- **RED banner top-left**: "MOBILE APP MODE" when width < 768px
- **BLUE banner top-right**: "DESKTOP MODE" when width >= 768px
- **Console logs** showing mobile detection status

### **üì± HOW TO TEST:**

1. **Deploy the updated code**
2. **Open in browser** and check console for logs
3. **Resize browser window** to < 768px width
4. **Look for the RED banner** saying "MOBILE APP MODE"
5. **You should see the new mobile app interface**:
   - App-style header with tribe info
   - Bottom tab navigation (Home, Map, Tribe, Diplomacy, Research)
   - Floating action button (+ button)
   - Card-based home screen

### **üì± MOBILE APP FEATURES YOU'LL SEE:**

**üè† Home Screen:**
- Tribe avatar and info at top
- Quick stats grid (Food, Troops, Weapons, Morale)
- Recent actions list
- Territory overview
- Quick action buttons

**üó∫Ô∏è Map Screen:**
- Full-screen map with touch controls
- Map control overlay (zoom buttons)
- Legend in bottom-left
- Hex selection with bottom sheet info

**‚ö° Floating Action Button:**
- Orange + button in bottom-right
- Shows action counter badge
- Opens bottom sheet for action management

**üì± Bottom Navigation:**
- 5 tabs: Home, Map, Tribe, Diplomacy, Research
- Active tab highlighted in amber
- Smooth animations between tabs

### **üîß IF STILL NOT WORKING:**

1. **Check browser console** for the debug logs
2. **Verify window width** is actually < 768px
3. **Try hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
4. **Check mobile device** or browser dev tools mobile view

### **üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

- **Desktop (‚â•768px)**: Blue banner, normal desktop layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Red banner, new mobile app layout with bottom tabs

**The mobile app should now be completely different from the desktop version!** üì±‚ú®

Deploy and test - you should see the transformation! üöÄ
